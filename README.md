# bot2vec

This is the source code of *bot2vec* network representation model which is designed to tackle bot detection task in multiple types of online social networks (OSNs). 

This work is an improved version of Node2Vec algorithm (https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec) with an extension of intra-community random walk strategy.
